    An <b>apple</b> is a round, edible fruit produced by an <b>apple tree</b> (<a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malus">Malus spp.,</a> among them the <b>domestic</b> or <b>orchard apple</b>;
    Malus domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The
    tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found. Apples have been grown
    for thousands of years in Eurasia and were introduced to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious
    and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.
