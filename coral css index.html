    Coral <b>bleaching</b> is the process when corals become white due to loss of symbiotic algae and photosynthetic pigments.  <b>This loss</b> (<a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_bleaching">Coral bleaching</a>  of pigment can be caused by various stressors, such as changes in water temperature, light, salinity, or nutrients. A <b>balanced</b> of <b>coral is not necessarily dead</b>;
    and some corals may survive.[3] However, a bleached coral is under stress, more vulnerable to starvation and disease, and at risk of death.[4][3] The leading cause of coral bleaching is rising ocean temperatures due to climate change.[5][6]
